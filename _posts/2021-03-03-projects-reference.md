My role: Programming in Unity, Sound Implementation & Music Direction.

[PROSPECTOR](https://studio3030.itch.io/prospector) is a narrative adventure game set in a futuristic city built on the rim of a giant crater, veiled in constant fog.

When a malfunction of your ship’s engine forces you to stay in this city for a while, you find yourself confronted with strange customs, masked faces and, maybe, the opportunity of a lifetime. Delve into the shrouded streets of the city, look behind the masks of its inhabitants and reveal what is hidden.
